Hi there, this program is by Will, Danny and Jennie. 
This application was written as part of Hack Quarantine, to help people in our communuty. Below is some more information about it.

Inspiration
The inspiration came from a local movement in our area, to post cards through peoples doors offering them help in these difficult times. The card system allows people to say who they are and what they can offer to people, and the recipient can phone the person on the card to help them get essential supplies, such as food and medicine. The system works great, except people don't know if houses have been delivered to, so they might get multiple cards and if you don't get a card there is no way to request help. Attempts to solve this so far are limited to a Facebook page and a WordPress website. Whilst these are both great, we thought that we could make something better and Hack Quarantine was the perfect opportunity to do it.

What it does
So far it does not do a lot, however we plan for that to change very quickly over the coming weeks. So far we have made the base template for the app and embedded the google maps API into our app, so we have a map to help it be obvious which area you are seeing in. I will attach a screenshot of the current state of the app. When completed we hope that it is a fully functioning digital replacement for the kindness cards, which also combats the issue of where the cards are by being able to see which streets have been covered.

How we built it
We built the program using Xamarin Forms through Visual studio. We had never used the it before but we decided it would be the best way to make the app, as it is cross platform between iOS and Android. We have it synced with GitHub which allows it to be edited by all of the team remotely. We are using Google maps API to allow the map to work, on the Android app and the Apple maps API for the iOS applications.

Challenges we ran into
We had many issues getting GitHub to sync between all of our laptops, however after getting past that issue we hit many more. After that we had trouble to get the buttons we managed to make link to other pages, after much trying we managed to get the thing the buttons linking to some pages which we haven't managed to edit yes. We also had many problems to get the keys that the API key requires to work. This took many attempts as it did not work on everybody's laptop as the keygen files were empty. However, we combated this because it worked on Danny's laptop we can all use that key however the map only builds if it's done on his PC.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of making the map work to the point where we can see it and navigate around the world. We are also proud of our idea, because we believe that it is beneficial after the project for the communities that we live in. We are also proud of the fact that our app can work on android and iOS devices.

What I learned
We have learnt how to make link buttons together and make the Xaramin forms map work. We learnt how to use GitHub properly and make sure they were all loading properly. We have also learnt how to communicate better, by making sure our code is understandable by only what we write and say to each other on slack because we are not completing the Hackathon at the same location or at the same times. We have also learnt how to organise a project and an idea better into logical steps to allow us all to make the program work at stages that it is obvious who and what needs to be done by other team members. Finally, we have learnt how to delegate the tasks to the best person, to make it work best for our app.

What's next for KindApp
Our next stages is to make the app collect and retain user data so that the cards can be put out and people can see who has requested help in their local area and who is willing to offer it. This would need to sink with a database of some description to make it available on all users devices. We would like it to show the map at the location your device is, not the center of Rome where it is currently showing. Finally, we would like there to be an in app messaging client which allows users to message each other to co-ordinate the help that they are giving or receiving. We hope that this will all be complete by the end of the Hackathon. We also want to design the app better and make it look professional, however our priority at the moment is getting it fully functioning. We hope that in the future we could publish it to the App Store and the Play Store, for people in communityâ€™s across the globe to use to help each other through the time of crisis we are currently living in.

To try it out you will need,
Visual Studio 2019 running on a Windows PC, 
All of the xaramin extenstions running

To use thee android version
An android emulator or Android device

To use the iOS version 
A Mac with Xcode and visual studio for mac installed, and remote login enbaled
An iPhone or iPad or the emulator built in.

We hope you enjoy using our app.
